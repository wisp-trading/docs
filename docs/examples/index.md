# Strategy Examples

Learn from complete, production-ready strategy implementations organized by complexity.

## Basic Strategies

Perfect for getting started with wisp. These strategies use 1-2 indicators and simple logic.

- **[RSI Strategy](basic/rsi)** - Classic momentum with oversold/overbought levels
- **[Moving Average Crossover](basic/ma-crossover)** - Golden/death cross trend following
- **[Bollinger Bands Mean Reversion](basic/bollinger-bands)** - Fade extremes, target the middle

## Intermediate Strategies

Add sophistication with multiple indicators, filters, and risk management.

- **[Multi-Indicator Confirmation](intermediate/multi-indicator)** - Require 3/4 signals to agree
- **[MACD with Trend Filter](intermediate/macd-momentum)** - Only trade with prevailing trend
- **[ATR Risk Management](intermediate/atr-risk)** - Dynamic stops and position sizing

## Advanced Strategies

Complex strategies for experienced traders: portfolios, arbitrage, and multi-asset.
